High-density EEG electrode placement
------------------------------------

    Some time ago we wrote an article on electrode placement for high-
    resolution EEG measurement (referred to as the `5% article`_). After its
    apearance I have noticed that there is a demand for a concise and
    methodological overview of electrode placement systems. With this page I
    want to share some of my knowledge on this subject. This page contains
    non-technical comments on the different standards for electrode
    placement. Furthermore I have included the electrode positions as
    measured and published by different researchers and the electrode
    locations according to the extended 10-20 standard on a spherical and on
    a realistical head model.





The official 10-20 standard
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

    At the first International EEG congress, held in London in 1947, it
    was recognised that a standard method of placement of electrodes used in
    electroencephalography (EEG) was needed. Possible methods to standardise
    electrode placement were studied by H.H. Jasper, which resulted in the
    definition of the 10-20 electrode system (`Jasper 1958`_). Since then,
    the 10-20 electrode system has become the de-facto standard for both
    clinical EEG and for the study of event related potentials (ERPs) in non-
    clinical settings. However, the advancement of multi-channel EEG hardware
    systems and of topographic methods to study evoked and event-related
    potentials, necessitated the standardisation of a larger number of
    channels. Therefore an extension to the original 10-20 system was
    proposed which increases the number of electrodes from 21 up to 74
    (`Chatrian et al. 1985`_). This extended 10-20 system of electrode
    placement, also known as the ?10\% system? or the ?10-10 system? has been
    accepted and is currently endorsed as the standard of the American
    Electroencephalographic Society (`AES 1994`_, `Klem et al. 1999`_) and
    the International Federation of Societies for Electroencephalography and
    Clinical Neurophysioly (`Nuwer 1998`_).





The 10% or the 10-10 system
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

    The original 10-20 standard consisted only of 21 electrodes. Although
    this is still considered to be enough for most clinical use, ERP research
    requires a higher density of electrodes. This does not mean that it is
    always neccessary to measure a lot of channels at the same time, but
    sometimes it desirable to place more electrodes in a certain area of
    interest, e.g. the area overlying primary sensory and motor areas where
    originally only C3 and C4 are located.

    In 1985, Chatrian suggested a logical extension of the 10-20 system.
    The original sytem places electrodes at distances of 10% and 20% along
    certain contours over the scalp. Chatrian simply extended this by placing
    electrodes at every 10% along the medial-lateral contours, and by
    introducing new contours in between the existing ones. As a matter of
    fact, the original proposed system by Jasper already anticipated upon the
    extra electrodes, by leaving the electrode names for the "1" and "5"
    electrodes free (e.g. C3 was added in between C1 and C5).

    The additional electrode positions of the 10% system have been
    adopted by the standardising comitees, and the official 10-20 system now
    includes these positions. To discriminate it with the original 10-20
    system, the standard is called the *extended 10-20 system*. It should be
    noted that the extended 10-20 system uses another nomenclature than the
    original 10% system, see the section on the `nomenclature`_ for more
    details.





The 5% or the 10-5 system
:::::::::::::::::::::::::

    This is our proposed extension of the 10-20 system to accomodate the
    large number of electrodes that are currently being used in EEG
    recordings in cognitive neuropscience. The 5% electrode system contains
    the standard locations of the original 10-20 system and those of the
    10-10 system. Our proposal is a logical extension of the 10-10 system,
    enabling the use of up to over 300 electrode locations. As the system
    uses proportional distances of 5% of the total length along contours
    between skull landmarks, compared to the 20% and 10% distances used in
    the 10-20 and 10-10 systems, respectively, we call it the 5% system or
    the 10-5 system.

    You can find all its details in the `5% article`_. Contact me if you
    want a reprint.





Nomenclature for electrode locations
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

    The nomenclature for the electrode locations, that is the name of
    each location, may look quite complicated for a newbie but follows a
    couple of simple rules:

    -   electrode names consist of a single or multiple letters, combined
    with a numer
    -   electrodes on the left are numbered **odd**, electrodes on the
    right are numbered **even**
    -   electrodes on the center (midline) are appended with the letter
    **z**. The z stands for zero (that is, not even and not odd). It is
    indicated by ?z? instead of the number ?0? to avoid confusion with the
    letter ?O?.
    -   electrodes near the midline (the zero-line) have the smallest
    numbers, and they increase towards the side
    -   the letter indicates the location on the head (actually the
    cortical lobe above which the electrode lies):

        -   **Fp**: *frontal pole*
        -   **F**: *frontal*
        -   **C**: *central*
        -   **T**: *temporal*
        -   **P**: *parietal*
        -   **O**: *occipital*

    -   combinations of two letters indicates intermediate locations,
    e.g.

        -   **FC**: in between frontal and central electrode
        locations
        -   **PO**: in between parietal and occipital electrode
        locations

    Combining these rules gives straight forward labels for all electrode
    positions. However, no rule is complete without some exceptions, and this
    also goes for the 10-20 standard.

    The contour in between the frontal pole (Fp) and the frontal (F)
    electrodes is called "AF" (anterio-frontal). The electrodes overlying the
    temporal lobe are indicated with a T. In the original 21 channel 10-20
    standard, the electrodes in the central contour running approximately
    from the vertex towards the left ear are labeled Cz-C3-T3. The
    untermediate locations C1 and C5 were added in the extended system, and
    location T3 was renamed to T7 (is also could have been called C7).
    Similarly, electrode T4 (old) has been renamed to T8. The parietal-
    temporal electrodes T5 and T6 (old) have been renamed to P7 and P8.
    Electrode T7 and T8 would correspond to C7 and C8. The fronto-central
    (FC) electrode row and the parieto-central (CP) electrode row use the
    letter T for the electrodes overlying the temporal lobe (e.g. FT7 and
    TP7). You only need to remember that "T" in the official `extended 10-20
    system`_ always can be read as "C". The electrode names T3, T4, T5 and T6
    are still commonly used in clinical EEG with 19 or 21 channels, but
    should not be used any more in experimental ERP studies.

    Although the extra electrode locations proposed in the 10% have been
    adopted right away, the nomenclature of the electrode locations has led
    to some debate. Chatrians original proposal used a single primes ' to
    indicate positions posterior of a known location. The electrode between
    C4 and P4 was called *C4'*. Likewise, electrode locations anterior of a
    known location were appended with a double prime '', so that the electrode
    between C4 and F4 becomes *C4''*. This system with single and double
    primes was only one of the alternative naming schemes for the
    intermediate locations. Other naming schemes introduced the additional
    letters B, D, E and H to designate intermediate coronal rows, or appended
    the letters a (for anterior) and p (for posterior) to the beginning or
    end of the electrode label. See `Nuwer (1987)`_ for a review of the
    suggestions that did not make it into the standard.

    The combination of two letters to indicate the electrode location is
    very intuitive, as it links the electrode label to the anatomical
    location on the scalp. It is similar to the naming of geographical
    directions, derived from the orientations of a compass. For example,
    halfway between North and West (at 315 degrees) lies the direction North-
    West. The direction halfway North and North-West (at 337.5 degrees) is
    commonly labelled North-North-West. In the `5% electrode system`_, we
    have proposed to use the same method for labelling the intermediate
    positions on the head in the antero-posterior direction. In this way, the
    locations on the contour between the C-contour and the CP-contour for
    example get labelled "CCP". This naming scheme for the coronal contours
    gives from anterior to posterior locations the following names: AF, AFF,
    F, FFC, FC, FCC, C, CCP, CP, CPP, P, PPO, PO. The contour halfway between
    Fp (frontal pole) locations and the AF contour would be called AFp (which
    we prefer over FpA). Likewise, the contour between the O locations and
    the PO contour would be called POO.

    Using a spherical description of the head, I have computed all
    electrode positions of the 10-5 electrode system.The 10-20 and 10-10
    electrode system all follow the same convention, and are included in this
    set.

    The first version ("sphere1") assumes Fpz, Oz, T7 and T9 to be on the
    poles of the sphere. The location of Nz, Iz, LPA and RPA is subsequently
    determined according to the following: Oz is at the equator, Cz is at the
    north-pole. The difference between them is 90 degrees or pi/2 along the
    surface of the unit sphere. The distance between each of Cz-CPz-Pz-POz-Oz
    is equal and is 22.5 degree (note that Pz is at 45 degrees from the
    north-pole). The distance between Iz and Oz is equal to the other
    distances, therefore Iz is at 22.5 below the equator. Using this, the
    coordinates of Iz can be computed using the sin() and cos() of 22.5
    degrees. The other "fiducial" points have similar coordinates. The Z
    value for the whole fiducial points contour is -sin(22.5)=-0.3827.

    In the second version ("sphere2") I have tried to mimic the electrode
    locations that are used in BESA as close as possible. Compared to the
    "sphere1" version described above, the electrodes are all shifted to
    slightly lower locations.

    I have also made a computation of all the electrode locations on a
    reallistical head surface, based on the distances along the
    (triangulated) surface of the head. The head surface used was constructed
    from the canonical MRI that is included in the SPM2 package, and
    locations are expressed in MNI coordinates.

    You can download ascii files with the labels and positions (expressed
    in carthesian coordinates) here:

    electrodes on a unit sphere (besa_81.txt)

        Good article! Well presented information! However, I would
        not agree that the naming conventions are intuitive (not your
        problem). Anterior and Central are not lobes. Either lobe name or
        position names should be used, not both. And what would be wrong with
        using L or R for right or left. And where does the TP section start
        and the T section end? And what does the 10 mean in front of 10-20
        and 10-5?

        Thatns for your comment. Let me comment on some of them.

        The naming indeed is not really intuitive, partially because
        the lobes of the brain are not apparent on the outside of the head,
        but partially also because there are just not enough lobes to give a
        sufficiently dense naming scheme. The mixture between lobes and
        location (central, anteroir, frontal) is to add more structure in the
        names. The problem with logical names is mainly over the frontal
        lobe.

        However, I am more concerned with people overinterpreting the
        ?lobe? part in the electrode name: there is a large inter-individual
        variation, and also electrode caps are not allways accurately
        designed or applied. So detailled knowledge of the relation between
        electrode and underlying brain area should not be assumed from the
        electrode name alone.

        Here are some answers to your questions:

        The ?TP? stands for temporo-parietal.

        The ?T? section is the lower part of the ?C? section. Below
        the horizontal line through C5, the ?C? is replaced in all labels by
        ?T?.

        The initial ?10? stands for the 10% distances along the
        nasion-inion and the LPA/RPA line at which the first electrodes are
        placed (Fpz, Oz, T7/3, T8/4). Those electrodes are very important,
        since they determine the height of the lowest horizontal contour,
        which in turn determines the position of the other contours.
