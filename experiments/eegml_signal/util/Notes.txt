				 http://psychophysiology.cpmc.columbia.edu/Software/CSDtoolbox/index.html
				 This looks a like a spherical approximation.


standard_1005.elc, standard_1020.elc, standard_alphabetic.elc, standard_postfixed.elc, standard_prefixed.elc, standard_primed.elc  are from eeglab9_0_4_5s/plugins/dipfit2.2/standard_BEM/elec/




				 

Note that the 10-20 and 10-10 change the names for a few of the electrodes

10/20  to   10/10
T3     ->   T7
T4     ->   T8
T5     ->   P7
T6     ->   P8

extended electrodes 
T1     ->   FT9
T2     ->   FT10
I have not yet figured out exactly where the T1 and T2 electrodes are, though I
think there are near FT9/FT10 in the 10/10 system. I believe the rule is
something like one-third ofthe distance between the pre-auricular point to the
lateral edge of the canthal fissue (eye). -CLM

*** OK a bit more definitive info below on T1 and T2***

The T1/T2 electrodes are not defined in the Jasper (1958) 10-20  
standard or the AES (American Electroencephalographic Society)  
extended 10-20 standard (published in 1991 and 1994 and probably at  
more occasions), but they are given in the Chatrian et al. 1985 Am J  
EEG Technol paper. That paper is the proposal that led to the  
extended 10-20 system. The T1 electrode is also shown in Chatrian et  
al 1988 (see pubmed references below). The names have become slightly  
different in the AES standard, but the locations are the same.

There is one vertical "column" of electrodes running from Cz-T7  
(T7=T3), and one "column" running from Fz-F7. In between those two  
columns are the FC electrodes, i.e. FCz-FT7 (FT7=FC7). The T1  
electrode seems to be located further down along the FC-line. That  
would mean that the location of T1 is approximately the same as the  
location of FT9.

The name and positon of electrode FT9 is defined in the AES standard  
(see below for the reference), and the position of that electrode is  
also included in the spherical/BESA and realistic/standard-BEM  
electrode files included with the DIPFIT plugin. The electrode system  
definitions are clarified and extended to >=128 electodes in our  
(Oostenveld & Praamstra) 2001 paper. That paper also describes the  
FT9 location. I can send you a pdf reprint upon request (I will not  
send it to the complete EEGLAB mailing list). On http://oase.uci.ru.nl/~roberto/index.php
you can also find more information  
and references.

I would say that it is important, but it depends on your goals.

Another study showing it is
  Khosla D, Don M, Kwong B.
  Spatial mislocalization of EEG electrodes -- effects on accuracy of  
dipole estimation.
  Clin Neurophysiol. 1999 Feb;110(2):261-71.

The statements in both papers also apply to ICA, except that in ICA  
it is more difficult to classify signal to noise ratio (since that  
depends on the quality of the ICA unmixing).

> You could state your improvement in percentual terms.

Dipole location is not expressed in percent, but in mm or cm. The  
accuracy of source localization depends on multiple factors:
- noise in the data
- location of the source (deep vs. superficial)
- accuracy of the source model (i.e. can the active tissue be  
represented as an infinitely small point source)
- accuracy of the volume conduction model geometry (sphere, vs.  
standard-realistic, vs. individual realistic)
- accuracy of the volume conduction model tissue conductivities
- accuracy of the volume conduction model numerical computation
- accuracy of the location of the electrodes in the model
- size of the recording area (i.e. whether electrodes are point-like,  
or whether they average over larger pieces of scalp)
- whether you interpret the source location on a template anatomical  
MRI or on the individuals MRI
- accuracy of the coregistration of the forward (source+volume) model  
with anatomical MRI
The list above probably is not even complete yet.

What I would be mainly concerned about is the volume conduction model  
errors.

Furthermore, I would also be concerned about systematic  
mislocalization of electrodes: Imagine the following: If you apply a  
cap that is much too small for the subject, the electrodes all will  
be higher on the head (since you cannot pull the cap sufficiently  
downward). That means that the scalp distribution of a known source  
will project _stronger_ on the lower electrodes on the cap (since  
those electrodes are too high on the head). That means if you do not  
take the placement of the electrodes into acocunt but use standard  
locations, the estimated source location will be deeper than the true  
location.

Hence systematic errors are the most problematic. Even if you do all  
source modelling to the best capabilities using standard software and  
only have "random" errors in your data and electrode locations, I  
would never trust the source location of EEG data to be more than  
~2cm accurate. That is not to say that it can be done more accurate,  
but that requires considerably more effort than I expect most EEGLAB/ 
DIPFIT users to put into source localization. Remember that the  
strong point of EEG is its temporal resolution: the source timecourse  
is what distinguishes EEG from fMRI, and timecourse separation is the  
strong point of ICA.

best regards,
Robert


### making edf browser montages

This is label dependent which can vary quite a bit


### Additional Note mne-python also has these in mne/channels/data or loaded in montages.py
- this includes standard positions for these
